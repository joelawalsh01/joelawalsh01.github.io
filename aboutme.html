									<h3>About Me</h3>
									<p>I am a current Phd student in STEM Education at UT Austin and M.S. in computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics. Prior to my time in Austin I was a high school mathematics teacher in Los Angeles, CA . My research focuses on the leveraging Natural Language Processing and knowledge graphs to create educational technologies. I have also participated in several computer science education projects, to include the nation's first year long Quantum Computing course alongside the Quantum Research Center at the Applied Research Laboratories and a data science education project with MathAction. I have also served in a number of mathematics and computer science teacher education roles within the Uteach program. I am currently working as an AI Research Intern at Finetune Learning and will be finished with my Phd in December of 2022.
